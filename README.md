# Chicago-CTA-Ridership-pre-post-COVID-datamining
Chicago data portal CTA ridership data mining

This project uses the API for the Chicago data portal to access ridership numbers for the CTA to visualize the active ridership pre and post covid

This was done using the pandas library in python to access and trim the data to make it more readable and then visualized using matplotlib
